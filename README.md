Java
Java 11 - you'll need a JDK installed on your machine.

Its recommended to use a tool to manage the version you have installed such as SDKMan or Homebrew [tool](https://sdkman.io/).

Once you have this you can install Java.

Gradle
Most projects you will come across will use Gradle as a build tool - you can install it from [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html).
